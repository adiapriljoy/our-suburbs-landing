This vigorous growth has fundamentally reset the city's position in the national landscape. No longer the affordable alternative, Brisbane is now experiencing rapid value appreciation across all dwelling types, reflecting its increasing appeal as a major Australian capital.</p><p>A key measure of this market shift is Brisbane now holding Australia's second-highest median house price, consistently surpassing $1 million. Intense competition for limited stock is forcing demand and price growth across both inner and outer suburbs. This premium status is further cemented by the unit market, where median values are also ranking second nationally, reinforcing the structural re-rating of Brisbane property.</p><p>The market's future remains positive, underpinned by population inflows and significant infrastructure spending, especially for the 2032 Olympics. However, the sheer pace of growth is expected to slow due to affordability limits. Persistent low inventory and high construction costs continue to exacerbate supply shortages, ensuring the market remains tight and competitive despite any moderation.</p></div></div></article></section></main></body></html>
